### Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge where participants solve one programming puzzle per day leading up to Christmas

## Structure

- Each day's solution is organized in its own directory (`Day-01`, `Day-02`, etc.).
- Solutions are implemented in Python.
- Input data for each day is included.
- Additional notes or explanations may be provided in each day's directory.


### Things learned:
* Learned how to make functionality for className "active" in navs and tabs
* Sharpened React JSX and CSS Flexbox skills.
* Learned how to combine two personal Solo Projects to make one dynamic project!

### Overall, a productive project which allowed for better understanding of Pop Up Modals.
